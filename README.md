'guess-my-word' is a simple console version of the Wordle game created with Python.

This is a small project that I developed as a student at North Matropolitan TAFE of WA, Australia, for the Certificate IV in IT (Programming Sprecialism) for the units ICTPRG430 - Apply introductory object-oriented language skills and ICTPRG444 - Analyse software requirements.

This game is based on New York Times' Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
